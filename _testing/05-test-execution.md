Now is the time to <b><i>execute</i></b> the test cases. Executing the test case means following:
<br><br>
(1.) fulfilling the <b><i>pre-conditions</i></b> by verifying or doing them manually 
<br><br>
(2.) Doing/Performing the <b><i>test steps</i></b> manually or using some device/tool as required
<br><br>
(3.) Noting down the <b><i>actual results</i></b> of the test steps performed
<br><br>
(4.) Comparing the <b><i>actual results</i></b> with the <b><i>expected results</i></b> of the test case. If the <b><i>actual results</i></b> match the <b><i>expected results</i></b>, the test case is declared <b><i>Passed</i></b>, otherwise <b><i>Failed</i></b>
<br><br>
(5.) If the test case fails, a <b><i>failure report</i></b> also known as <b><i>DEFECT</i></b> is written and presented to the responsible team for repair or corrective action.
