Very true, 😁. We already learned that a failed test case in most of the cases will result in a <b>failure report</b> or <b><i>DEFECT</i></b>. 
<br><br>
<b>if</b> [ <b>actual results</b> not equals <b>expected results</b> ]  then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;report <b>failure</b> or <b>DEFECT</b>;
<br>
<b>end if</b>
