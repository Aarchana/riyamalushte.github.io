We listed some tests that we would like to do on a new mobile phone. Let’s take one of the tests and elaborate it bit more.
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Sure 👍.
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
How about "Make a call from mobile phone"? Can you describe the test and its objective in 200 characters or less?
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
<i>Verify the mobile phone can dial another telephone/mobile number and do voice communication with remote person after the call is connected.</i>
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Wow, that’s 139 characters. You could have twitted it 😁. We call it <b>Test Description.</b>
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Which all things you would like to be already there to conduct the test?
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(1.) The mobile phone’s battery should be charged and the phone should be in Switched ON state.
<br><br>
(2.) The mobile phone should have an activated SIM card and a mobile number of a remote person should be available for dialing.
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %}
Great, above list of items are called <i><b>Pre-Requisites</b></i> or <i><b>Pre-Conditions</b></i>. Without these things, we cannot start our test or we will not be able to carry out some of the actions required to do the test.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %}
Now, let’s jot down the list of actions we will perform to do the mentioned test. 
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(1.) Open the phone app or dialer app or dial pad in the phone
<br><br>
(2.)  Type the desired phone number or mobile number using the numeric dial pad or keypad
<br><br>
(3.)  Press or touch press the dial button in your phone app or dialer app or dial pad
<br><br>
(4.)  Place the earpiece/speaker of the mobile phone near your ears with the mouthpiece or mic towards your mouth
{% include msgaltend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %}
That’s neat 👍. We call these as <i><b>Test Steps</b></i>. Now, write down the results you are expecting after you have performed all the 4 steps listed above. 
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %}
(1.) Should be able to hear audible ringing or ringback/ringing tone.
<br><br>
(2.) Once the remote person accepts the call, each other’s voice should be clearly audible to both calling and called parties
{% include msgaltend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %}
👏👏👏 these are called <i><b>Expected Results</b></i>.
{% include msgend.html %}
