Hi, I have joined the software testing team. You have been assigned my mentor. Can you please share some study material to start with?
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Welcome onboard! You don't need any study material to start with.
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Then?
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
God created testers first and then called them male and female.
{% include msgend.html %} 
{% include msgstart.html %} 
To start with, can you please list down different types of senses we have?
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
taste, touch, smell, hear, sight
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Good. Now, visualize one Gupta Jee in a sweet shop, tasting different flavors of barfis and then settling down for 250 gms of jalebi 😜. Isn’t that a very common example of testing using the sense of taste 😃?

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
😄😁
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Now, think of a kid in a winter morning, touching the water in bucket to check if it’s too cold before taking bath. Sense of touch used for testing.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Here’s one for you. Imagine yourself at Shoppers Stop and trying different perfumes from samplers. Sense of smell used for testing
